# Defining Digital Humanities

There is a [lack of consensus](http://dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu/debates/text/40) when it comes to a set definition for the Digital Humanities (DH). However, many agree that digital humanities research requires utilizing technology to ask traditional humanities questions in new ways and about new subjects.  

***

## Digital Humanities *is*:
- **Data-driven**:
    - Involving data of some sort (though this data takes many forms)
- **Diverse**:
    - Accross institutions, DH operates in different ways
- **Collaborative**:
    - Research often involves a community that crosses disciplinary lines to exchange ideas and build projects

## Digital Humanities is *not*:
- A "replacement" of traditional humanities research methods
    - Rather, DH works hand-in-hand to extend the possibilities of deep thinking and criticism that characterizes the humanities, and the creativity that embodies the arts
