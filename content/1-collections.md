# UI Digital Collections

The digitization we do here goes hand-in-hand with our digital scholarship roles.

Here in the digital lab, we work to preserve and disseminate archival material, an endeavor that requires not only expertise in digitization processes but also dedication to documenting and recording information about the items we digitize.
