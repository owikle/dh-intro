# UI Digital Collections

The digitization we do goes hand-in-hand with our digital scholarship roles:

“[D]igitization is the process by which complex objects are made simpler by breaking them down into smaller units. It is not merely a phenomenon of the current age, but an active force throughout technological history.” 
- Matthew Kirschenbaum, 134, *Mechanisms: New Media and the Forensic Imagination*, 2008.

Here in the digital lab, we work to preserve and disseminate archival material, an endeavor that requires not only expertise in digitization methods and processes but also dedication to documenting and recording information about the items we digitize.
