# Homework:

Read this short chapter on Father Roberto Busa’s female workforce who were instrumental in building the first computational linguistic word concordance tool, which was a database of Thomas Aquinas’s writing (concordance here meaning that this tool allowed researchers to explore the contexts in which Aquinas used specific words). 
These women created punch cards for each word that the computer then interpreted as data. 
In the end, the total word count was close to 11 million. 
This is a famous project in Digital Humanities because it’s commonly regarded as marking the beginning of computational humanities.

- Busa's "Index Thomisticus", translated for the web: <https://www.corpusthomisticum.org/it/index.age>
- Data punch cards: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punched_card>

Start thinking about not only the history of physical computing, but also the transformation of words into data and the invisible labor that all too often goes into data creation.
