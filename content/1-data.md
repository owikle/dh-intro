# Digitization

The digitization we do goes hand-in-hand with our digital scholarship roles:

{% capture text %}
"[D]igitization is the process by which complex objects are made simpler by breaking them down into smaller units. It is not merely a phenomenon of the current age, but an active force throughout technological history."
- Matthew Kirschenbaum, 134, *Mechanisms: New Media and the Forensic Imagination*, 2008.

Here at UI, we digitize material from the archives and make it available online.

This requires documenting and recording information about the items we digitize...

# Data

How do humanists think about data?

"...imagine that someone called your family photograph album a dataset. It’s not inaccurate per se, but it suggests that this person just fundamentally doesn’t understand why you value this artifact. And it’s the same with humanists. With a source, like a film or a work of literature, you’re not extracting features in order to analyze them; you’re trying to dive into it, like a pool, and understand it from within."
- See Miriam Posner, "[Humanities Data: A Necessary Contradiction](https://miriamposner.com/blog/humanities-data-a-necessary-contradiction/)," *Miriam Posner's Blog*, June 25, 2015.
