#### File Type

Generally, there is a distinction between two broad types of computer files: **text** or **binary**.

{% capture filetype %}
- **Text Files** contain only bytes that represent text characters organized in lines (e.g. `a`, `B`, space, tab, line breaks, etc.). They can be opened with a text editor to see the characters. For example, TXT, CSV, HTML, or MD files.
- **Binary Files** contain bytes that are NOT text characters. They will require software (other than a text editor) that can correctly interpret the bytes. For example, a JPG image, MP3 sound file, or a ZIP compressed folder.

Usually, when talking about text files when doing text analysis, we mean **plain text**: text files that contain only Unicode-encoded characters like `a`, `1`, `<`, `!`, etc. 
Some characters might be “hidden” control characters, such as tabs and line breaks.

{% endcapture %}
<div class="row justify-content-center">{% include card.md text=filetype %}</div>

Having text in this simple format enables it to be manipulated as data.

# Homework:

Read this short chapter on Father Roberto Busa’s female workforce who were instrumental in building the first computational linguistic word concordance tool, which was a database of Thomas Aquinas’s writing (concordance here meaning that this tool allowed researchers to explore the contexts in which Aquinas used specific words). 
These women created punch cards for each word that the computer then interpreted as data. 
In the end, the total word count was close to 11 million. 
This is a famous project in Digital Humanities because it’s commonly regarded as marking the beginning of computational humanities.

- Busa's "Index Thomisticus", translated for the web: <https://www.corpusthomisticum.org/it/index.age>
- Data punch cards: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punched_card>

Start thinking about not only the history of physical computing, but also the transformation of words into data and the invisible labor that all too often goes into data creation.
